# EDA-bivariate-analysis
In my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I performed bivariate analysis using various visualizations to examine the relationships between different pairs of variables. Specifically, I used:

Scatterplot: To visualize the relationship between two continuous variables and observe how one variable changes in relation to the other.

Barplot: To display the distribution of a categorical variable against a continuous variable, allowing for easy comparison of different categories.

Boxplot: To summarize the distribution of a continuous variable across different categories, highlighting medians, quartiles, and potential outliers.

Distplot: To show the distribution of a single continuous variable, combining a histogram and a kernel density plot for a comprehensive view.

Heatmap: To illustrate the intensity of the relationship between two continuous variables using color gradients, particularly useful for correlation matrices.

Clustermap: To identify patterns and group similar observations by combining a heatmap with hierarchical clustering.

Pairplot: To generate a grid of scatterplots for all possible pairs of continuous variables, aiding in identifying relationships and patterns across multiple variables.

Lineplot: To display data points connected by lines, commonly used to show trends over time for continuous variables.

These visualizations enabled me to identify patterns, trends, and potential correlations between variables, enhancing my understanding of the data.
